### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/Happr

## Usage

Happr offers a straightforward and intuitive platform for creators to receive support and for fans to show their appreciation.

### Landing Page
The application's entry point is the `LandingPage`, which effectively communicates Happr's core value proposition and features:

*   **Hero Section**: A dynamic and inviting introduction that highlights Happr's mission: "Made with love. Paid in Smiles."

*   **Pricing Section**: Articulates Happr's transparent fee structure, clearly showing that creators retain 95% of every "Smile."
*   **Join Us Section**: An interactive module that allows prospective creators to claim their unique `happr.me/username` page.

### User Authentication
Users can seamlessly sign up for new accounts or sign in to existing ones through dedicated authentication routes:

*   **Sign Up (`/signup`)**:
    1.  **Claim Username**: Begin by choosing and claiming a unique `happr.me/username`. This ensures your page is personalized and easy to share.
    2.  **Account Creation**: After selecting a username, proceed to create your account using either an email and password combination or via Google authentication for a quicker setup.
*   **Sign In (`/signin`)**:
    -   Log in to your existing Happr account securely using your registered email and password or by leveraging Google authentication.

Throughout the authentication process and other user interactions, `sonner` is utilized to display clear and concise toast notifications, providing instant feedback on actions and any potential issues (e.g., "Invalid username input").
